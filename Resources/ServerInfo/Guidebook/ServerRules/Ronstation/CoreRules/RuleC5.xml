  # 5: Zero Tolerance for Meta-Communications and Meta-Gaming.

This rule prohibits any method of sharing or exploiting round-specific information that is not provided to you by the game in-character (IC).

Players should never harm and/or help other players because of OOC conflicts or relationships. Never use out-of-character knowledge your character could not reasonably know in-character.

Public live streams and/or attempting to teach (new) players are not exempt from this rule.

Meta-communications and Meta-Gaming undermine fair play. When in doubt, ask yourself: "Could this info give me or others an unfair advantage?"
