  # 2. Don't be a jerk. There is Zero Tolerance for Bigotry and Discrimination.
Be excellent to each other. Don't do anything with the goal of negatively affecting other players. Not everyone is going to enjoy every round. Being a jerk in-character is fine to a point, but being a jerk out of character is not welcome.

This rule prohibits any and all forms of hate speech, marginalization, and discrimination either in-character (IC) or out-of-character (OOC).

The following are examples given and are strictly prohibited by this rule, even if framed as roleplay or "in-character" actions.


## 2.1e: Racism/Speciesism:
- Derogatory remarks about real-world races or in-game species (e.g., "Lizardpeople are disgusting").

## 2.2e: Sexism & Gender-Based Discrimination:
- Mocking pronouns, misgendering, or sexist stereotypes (e.g., "Women shouldn’t be Engineers").

## 2.3e: Anti-LGBTQ+ Behavior:
- Using LGBTQ+ identities as insults (e.g., "That’s so gay" negatively) or purposefully denying a character’s identity.

## 2.4e: Religious Intolerance:
- Attacking real-world religions or beliefs (e.g., "Your god is fake").

## 2.5e: Identity-Based Targeting:
- Harassing players based on nationality, disability, or other characteristics.

## Slurs:
- 2.6e: Any use of slurs, including "reclaimed" or "positive" contexts.

This server is a safe space. Bigotry has no place here, even in fiction.
