  # 7: Roleplay a Coherent, Believable Character.

This rule ensures immersive roleplay by requiring players to act like in-universe characters.

This game is about working together to create a story through authentic character choices, so your character’s decisions should feel natural to the setting and their role in it. Ask yourself, “What would my character do?”—not “How do I win?”. Players should embody their characters by acting as part of the game world—not like a real person playing a game. Lighthearted or eccentric characters are allowed, but they must still feel believable. Playstyles that ignore any opportunities for participation or roleplay are prohibited.
